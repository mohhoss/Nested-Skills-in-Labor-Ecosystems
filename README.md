## Bootstrapping Burning Glass Job Sequence
The sample upon which the code operates is cleaned job sequences obtained from Burning Glass resumes in the form of Data.Frame.

Input: The code imports such a job sequence Data.Frame, imports O*NET Skills (skill, ability, and knowledge data), as well as skill clusters (groups) and categories, as defined by the manuscript.

Output: The output is a randomized Data.Frame of job switches, and measured skill levels as per randomized job switches.
